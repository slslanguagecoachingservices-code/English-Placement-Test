		"When people imagine the history of innovation, they often picture a lone genius working tirelessly in isolation, eventually unveiling a revolutionary breakthrough. Yet, this narrative is misleading. Most transformative inventions were not sudden strokes of brilliance, but rather the culmination of countless incremental steps, frequently shaped by collaboration, error, and even sheer accident. The discovery of penicillin, for instance, was hardly the outcome of a meticulous experiment; instead, it emerged from Alexander Fleming’s seemingly trivial oversight—neglecting to clean a petri dish.
		</em></p>
		<p><em>
		Equally significant is the social and economic context in which innovations unfold. The steam engine did not transform society merely because of its mechanical efficiency, but because it aligned with the needs of an industrializing Europe eager for faster transport and mass production. Similarly, our current fascination with artificial intelligence is not solely due to its technical sophistication; it reflects broader cultural anxieties about human obsolescence and an appetite for efficiency that borders on obsession.
		</em></p>
		<p><em>
		Thus, to attribute innovation to individual brilliance alone is to misunderstand its essence. What truly propels human progress is the intricate interplay between chance, collaboration, and societal demand—factors far messier, and far more human, than the myth of the solitary genius would suggest."

		<h4>Reading Passage</h4>
		<div style="max-height: 250px; overflow-y: auto; padding: 12px; background: #fefcff; border: 1px solid #e6e6fa; border-radius: 8px; font-size: 14px;">

		"The concept of resilience has been widely adopted across disciplines, from ecology to psychology and economics. At first glance, resilience appears to denote a straightforward quality: the ability of a system or individual to ‘bounce back’ from adversity. Yet, on closer examination, the notion is far less simplistic. In ecological studies, resilience does not imply returning to a prior state, but rather the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb disturbances while continuing to function, even if in a transformed state. Likewise, in psychology, resilience is less about eliminating distress and more about sustaining meaningful engagement with life despite ongoing hardship.
		</em></p>
		<p><em>
		However, the widespread embrace of resilience as a buzzword has generated criticism. Some scholars argue that valorizing resilience risks obscuring structural inequities by placing responsibility on individuals to adapt, rather than on institutions to reform. For example, exhorting workers to develop resilience in the face of exploitative labor conditions may normalize injustice rather than challenge it. In this sense, resilience can become complicit with systems of power, quietly reinforcing the very problems it purports to address.
		</em></p>
		<p><em>
		On the other hand, rejecting resilience outright is equally problematic. To deny its significance is to overlook the undeniable fact that human and ecological systems alike do adapt, often in astonishingly creative ways. The challenge, therefore, lies in distinguishing between resilience as an empowering capacity and resilience as a rhetorical tool that excuses structural failure. Only by maintaining this distinction can we appreciate the concept’s complexity and avoid its misuse.
		</em></p>
		<p><em>
		Ultimately, resilience is neither an unqualified virtue nor an empty cliché. It is a contested terrain, reflecting both the promise of human adaptability and the perils of overlooking the conditions that necessitate it in the first place."
